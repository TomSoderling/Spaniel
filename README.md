# Spaniel
An app for giving your RESTful web service endpoints a health checkup

## Known Limitations: 
 - Endpoint results from quick actions disappear after going back to ProjectList page and stay gone till app is force-closed
 - Currently, only GET requests are supported - HttpClient.GetAsync()
 - LaunchScreen.storyboard image on iPad doesnâ€™t look too hot

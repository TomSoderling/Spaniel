# Spaniel
Spaniel is a Xamarin.Forms app for iOS and Android for running health checkups for your RESTful web service endpoints.  

Features:  
 - Standard layout for phone and master-detail layout for tablet devices
 - Quick actions for devices that support 3D Touch


## Known Limitations 
 - Endpoint results from quick actions disappear after going back to ProjectList page and stay gone till app is force-closed
 - Currently, only GET requests are supported - HttpClient.GetAsync()
 - LaunchScreen.storyboard image on iPad doesn’t look too hot
